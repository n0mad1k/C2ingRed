C2ingRed Post-Installation Instructions
================================================================

To complete your setup with SSL certificates, run:
  /root/Tools/post_install_c2.sh

This script will guide you through:
- Setting up Let's Encrypt certificates
- Starting required services
- Setting up the redirector (if desired)
- Displaying DNS configuration recommendations

For enhanced OPSEC, you can also randomize ports:
  /root/Tools/randomize_ports.sh

Run these after you've configured your DNS records to point to this server.
