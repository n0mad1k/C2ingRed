C2itall Redirector Post-Installation Instructions
================================================================

To complete your setup with SSL certificates, run:
  /root/Tools/post_install_redirector.sh

This script will guide you through:
- Setting up Let's Encrypt certificates
- Starting required services
- Updating NGINX configuration

For enhanced OPSEC, you can also randomize ports:
  /root/Tools/randomize_ports.sh

Run these after you've configured your DNS records to point to this server.
